# B.tryoni_PopGenomics
Population genomic analysis of the invasive Queensland fruit fly, _Bactrocera tryoni_.

Here we will use the DarTseq data generated by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67397-5" title="Popa‑Báez et al (2020)" >Popa‑Báez et al (2020)</a> from the native and expanded ranges of _B. tryoni_ to understand population genomic underpinnigs of invasion success. We will use genome-wide scan methods and environmental association analyses to identify SNPs potentially under selection in _B. tryoni_.
