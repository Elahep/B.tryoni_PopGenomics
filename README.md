# Identifying genomic signal of local adaptation in the invasive Queensland fruit fly, _Bactrocera tryoni_

Here we will use the DarTseq data generated by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67397-5" title="Popa‑Báez et al (2020)" >Popa‑Báez et al (2020)</a> from the native and expanded ranges of _B. tryoni_ to understand population genomic underpinnigs of invasion success. We use genome-wide scan to identify highly differentiated genomic variants (SNPs) associated with the invasive status of _B. tryoni_ populations. Additionally, we determined which environmental variables have a key role in shaping allelic trends across the distribution range of _B. tryoni_.
