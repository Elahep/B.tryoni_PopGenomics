To infer rates and patterns of gene-flow between different populations, we will apply two methods. First, we will extimate migration surfaces and indentify areas with higher-than-average or lower-than-average historical gene-flow rates using the program EEMS. Next, we will calculate directional relative migration rates and quantify asymmetry in patterns of gene-flow using the R package DivMigrate.
